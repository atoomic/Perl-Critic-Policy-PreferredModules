# MODULES

# CONFIGURATION

To use [Perl::Critic::Policy::PreferredModules](https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl%3A%3ACritic%3A%3APolicy%3A%3APreferredModules) you have first to enable it in your
 `.perlcriticrc` file by providing a `preferred_modules.ini` configuration file:

```perl
[PreferredModules]
config = /path/to/preferred_modules.ini
# you can also use '~' in the path for $HOME
#config = ~/.preferred_modules
```

The  `preferred_modules.ini` file is using the [Config::INI](https://metacpan.org/pod/Config%3A%3AINI) format and can looks like this

```perl
[Do::Not::Use]
prefer = Another::Package
reason = "Please use Another::Package rather than Do::Not::Use"

[Avoid::Using::This]
[And::Also::That]

[No:Reason]
prefer=A::Better:Module

[Only::Reason]
reason="If you use this module, a puppy might die."
```
